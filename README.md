## 1.Breast Cancer Survival Prediction with Machine Learning.
Machine learning can be used to predict the survival rate of breast cancer patients. The process involves using a dataset of patient information, such as age, tumor_stage, Proteins and treatment history, to train a model. The model can then be used to predict the Patient_Status for new patients with similar characteristics.
## 2.Stress Detection with Machine Learning. Based on live human vitals, predict the stress levels of humans.
Stress detection with machine learning involves using physiological data collected from live humans, such as heart rate and skin conductance, to predict an individual's stress levels. This can be done by training a machine learning model on a dataset of labeled physiological data and stress levels, and then using that model to make predictions on new, unseen data. The goal of such a system would be to accurately identify periods of high stress in individuals, potentially allowing for early interventions to prevent negative health effects associated with chronic stress.
## 3.Train and Give Inputs to a Machine Learning Model.
In this Project, we are required to train a model and give inputs to them. Here, we will be using Random Forest machine learning algorithm to predict the House pricing.
House prediction is the task of predicting the value or price of a house based on a set of features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. This is a regression problem where the goal is to predict a continuous value.
There are various approaches to solve this problem, one of them is using a machine learning algorithm such as random forest. The first step would be to collect and label a dataset of house prices and corresponding features. Next, the dataset would be split into training and testing sets. Then a random forest model would be trained on the training set using a set of features. The trained model can then be used to make predictions on the testing set, and the performance of the model would be evaluated using metrics such as mean absolute error or root mean squared error.
The goal of this task is to create a model that can accurately predict the value of a house based on its features, which can be used by real estate agents, buyers, or sellers to make informed decisions
